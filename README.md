# To work on this page, you need to download github for visual studio and the github desktop client 
# https://visualstudio.github.com/ || https://desktop.github.com/
# After that is done, we can begin working on it. Make sure everytime you make a change you "push" it
# Meanwhile, make sure you are "pulling" BEFORE YOU CHANGE ANTHING. This is to ensure we don't overwrite or mess up any work.
